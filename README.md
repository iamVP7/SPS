This is my First Android application develop using Java. The idea of this application is to bring olden days hand game back to smart phones. One such game is Stone Paper Scissor. 

The application is very to use and the game is very Easy to learn.

you have to choose either stone, paper or scissor.
Your android phone will choose anything randomly. Dont worry. It wont cheat!!!
The "rock" beats scissors,
the "scissors" beat paper,
the "paper" beats rock;
if both players throw the same shape, the game is tied.
Try to get 15 points as soon as possible. 
If you win your Phone then your score will increase by adding 2. If you lose then 1 point will be decremented.
All the best to get your Cup at final.
